Movie Recommender System 🎬
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Movie Recommender System developed using natural language processing techniques. The system suggests similar movies to a given input movie based on content similarity. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and uses the TF-IDF Vectorizer along with Cosine Similarity for recommendations.

🔧 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy - Data Manipulation

Scikit-Learn - TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity

Jupyter Notebook - Development Environment

📂 Dataset

The dataset used contains information about movies such as titles, genres, keywords, and more. The data is pre-processed to extract relevant features for accurate recommendations.

🚀 Features

Takes input of a movie title from the user.

Uses TF-IDF to convert text data to numerical vectors.

Computes cosine similarity to find and recommend movies with similar content.

📁 File Structure

Movie Recommender system-checkpoint.ipynb: Main project notebook containing the implementation.

🔎 How to Use

Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.

Run the notebook cells in sequence.

Provide a movie title as input to get a list of recommended movies.

📈 Future Improvements

Integrate a user-based or collaborative filtering approach.

Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.

Expand the dataset for better and more diverse recommendations.
